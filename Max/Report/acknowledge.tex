\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{C:ack}
I would like to thank my supervisor Marcus Frean for the constant support and
mentorship throughout the year. Also for teaching me so much, and the opportunity to
work on something so neat. I would also like to
thank Stephen Marsland, co-inceptor of the idea for this project.
