\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ORBM inference is working in smaller cases really well. Even better than the RBM!
  \item Training algorithm for this generative model has been proposed. Haven't been able to get it going but it could be really promising - Amounts to blind source separation.
\end{itemize}
