\begin{abstract}

In machine learning encoding prior knowlegde about a task can be essential to the technqiues ability to perform well on said task.(Big mental leap here....) This report explores and evaluates a novel approach to modelling data that is caused by two, independant sources. The theory has been proposed by Frean, Marcus and Marsland, Stephen, leveraging the popular Restricted Boltzmann Machine as a model for a source and a Sigmoid Belief Network as the way for these complex causes to combine. A new algorithm is presented under the dynamics of this model that allow indepedant representations of multi-cause data to be represented given a multi-cause input.
